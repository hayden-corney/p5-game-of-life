# P5 Game of Life

This is a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), using the [Array2D.js](https://github.com/matthewtoast/Array2D.js) library.

It is based on the YouTube video [Coding Challenge #85: The Game of Life](https://youtu.be/FWSR_7kZuYg) by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw).
